# XNFSMusicPlayerInstaller
The ingame controlled setup application for XNFSMusicPlayer.

## Running
- Install the ASI loader from ThirteenAG's WFP if you already haven't: https://thirteenag.github.io/wfp#nfs
- Copy the compiled .asi into the scripts folder
- Copy the XNFSInstallerTools into the scripts folder

It is imperative that you have the XNFSMusicPlayer.ini from the music player as well to store settings.

## TODO:
There's a lot to be desired here. Currently this is uploaded only as a proof-of-concept, supporting only Most Wanted.

- Replace "Button 1" with a blank button
- figure out undefined situations
